### Section 1: Introduction to Prompt Engineering

#### What is Prompt Engineering
    # A multidisciplinary branch of engineering focused on interacting with AI through the
    # integration of fields including Software Engineering, ML, Cognative Science, Business
    # Philosophy, Psychiatry, and Computer Science
#### Why is Prompt Engineering even a thing?
    # when the LLMs get big enough, they become much more useful and develop "intelligence"
    # no one knows exactly how LLMs are able to do what they do
    # Prompt Engineering is part of the quest to figure that out
    # prompt quality exponentially improves output performance
#### Breaking GPT
    # using ChatGPT play ground -- you'll learn how to set this up later in the course
    # the only time the LLMs "Think" is when they're typing...
    # if you don't understand how these models work, you'll be at a disadvantage 
#### Applied Prompt Engineering
    # applying the knowledge of LLMs to real world
    # learn the skill and it will help you in all areads of your life
#### Applied Prompt Engineering with NASA
    # BIDARA: ChatGPT-based chatbot that was instructed to help scientists, engineers
        # understand, learn from, and emulate the strategies used by living things
        # to create sustainable design and tech
    # Prompt does all of these  things
        # 1. Tells ChatGPT it is an expert in biomimetic design and other fields
        # 2. Creates a workflow for the next four steps
        # 3. Creates a step-by-step process for ChatGPT - process to be followed
        # 4. Requires the model to provide evidence in the form of peer-reviewed sources
        # 5. Makes the odel respond with expert-level responses (hints are provided too)
#### Why is Prompt Engineering Important to You?
    # The hottest new programming language is English
    # You need to get good at prompt engineering; don't be bad
    # AI won't take your job but a person using AI will take your job
