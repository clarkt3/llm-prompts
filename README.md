### Section 1: Introduction to Prompt Engineering

#### What is Prompt Engineering
    # A multidisciplinary branch of engineering focused on interacting with AI through the
    # integration of fields including Software Engineering, ML, Cognative Science, Business
    # Philosophy, Psychiatry, and Computer Science
#### Why is Prompt Engineering even a thing?
    # when the LLMs get big enough, they become much more useful and develop "intelligence"
    # no one knows exactly how LLMs are able to do what they do
    # Prompt Engineering is part of the quest to figure that out
    # prompt quality exponentially improves output performance
#### Breaking GPT
    # using ChatGPT play ground -- you'll learn how to set this up later in the course
    # the only time the LLMs "Think" is when they're typing...
    # if you don't understand how these models work, you'll be at a disadvantage 
#### Applied Prompt Engineering
    # applying the knowledge of LLMs to real world
    # learn the skill and it will help you in all areads of your life
