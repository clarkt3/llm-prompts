### Section 1: Introduction to Prompt Engineering

#### What is Prompt Engineering
    # A multidisciplinary branch of engineering focused on interacting with AI through the
    # integration of fields including Software Engineering, ML, Cognative Science, Business
    # Philosophy, Psychiatry, and Computer Science
#### Why is Prompt Engineering even a thing?
    # when the LLMs get big enough, they become much more useful and develop "intelligence"
    # no one knows exactly how LLMs are able to do what they do
    # Prompt Engineering is part of the quest to figure that out
    # prompt quality exponentially improves output performance
#### Breaking GPT
    # using ChatGPT play ground -- you'll learn how to set this up later in the course
    # the only time the LLMs "Think" is when they're typing...
    # if you don't understand how these models work, you'll be at a disadvantage 

## Day 2

#### Applied Prompt Engineering
    # applying the knowledge of LLMs to real world
    # learn the skill and it will help you in all areads of your life
#### Applied Prompt Engineering with NASA
    # BIDARA: ChatGPT-based chatbot that was instructed to help scientists, engineers
        # understand, learn from, and emulate the strategies used by living things
        # to create sustainable design and tech
    # Prompt does all of these  things
        # 1. Tells ChatGPT it is an expert in biomimetic design and other fields
        # 2. Creates a workflow for the next four steps
        # 3. Creates a step-by-step process for ChatGPT - process to be followed
        # 4. Requires the model to provide evidence in the form of peer-reviewed sources
        # 5. Makes the odel respond with expert-level responses (hints are provided too)
#### Why is Prompt Engineering Important to You?
    # The hottest new programming language is English
    # You need to get good at prompt engineering; don't be bad
    # AI won't take your job but a person using AI will take your job

### Section 2: Choose Your LLM

#### What I'm Using - Part 1

#### Optional Setting Up Your Playground

    # playground setup complete
    # MFA setup complete
    # monethly budget setup complete

#### Multi-Modality and Tools in LLMS

    # testing auto-save
    # auto-save setup complete
    # what's multi-modailty?
        # understands text; generates text back
        # it understand images, too; pass it images
    # watch HAL 9000 tonight
    # keypoint: GPT can accept text, images and gen text, images
    # be careful of hallucinations - where things are just made up
    # third model: python execution
        # chatGPT can execute python code

    # Test: Calculate the Fibonacci sequence up to the 10th number

    # Summary
        1. Accept and generate text
        2. Accept and generate images
        3. Browse the internet
        4. Execute Python code

#### Choose You LLM!

    # choose GPT (obviously

### Section 3: Guided Proejct - Build Your First Game (Snake Game)

#### Project Introduction
    
    # creating a snake game using an LLM
    # create new repo for game?
    # add code right here and run it in replit

    ```Python  

    ```

#### Building Our Snake Game - Part 1

    # previous messages in a chat infulence all other messages within that same chat
    # feed instructions to GPT before prompting for code generation
    # the key here being you need to "warm" GPT up before prompting by asking for steps (in some cases)
    # you provide it context and it helps make responsed more accurate

#### Building Our Snake Game - Part 2

    # manipulating code to change background color
        # simply ask chat gpt where to update the color within the code base it provided
