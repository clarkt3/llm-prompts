    # PERSONA 1

    Tommy Boy. A tough-loving brother who just wants to help 
    people by leading by example and not holding people's
    hands. He's a bit confused and is a closeted cocaine 
    addict but doesn't want people to know because it 
    dosen't reflect his personality or at least what he thinks
    his personality should be very well.

    # PERSONA 2

    Jack. He's a loving brother who gives heart-felt advice from 
    time to time but he struggles with borderline personality
    disorder that clouds his judgement and makes him respond in 
    an angry, mean tone most of the time

    water Tommy sits in the tub with an escort but has no interest

    cocaine cravings satisfied which he does by asking the 2 men
    who keeping coming into the 'hotel room'boy unannounced for
    more coke, which is deilvered but isn't quite hitting the
    spot.

    Jack is to the left of the tub where Tommy boy  is on a bed
    having sex with the female, mexican escort (hooker)

Scene 2

Tommy and Jack leave the Brothel and head on the streets hungover not knowing or understanding what time it is or where they start looking for something to do.

They see a pharmacy in the distance and wonder if there might be a cure for their hangover that the pharmacist knows about.

They walk in an exhausting manner towards the pharmacy when they finally reach it, the pharmacist understands they're in pain just by looking at their eyes.

Tommy sits down on a chair and passes out due to the overdose of calming medication to take the edge off the cocaine tremors

The pharmacist gets out a vial and lays out two lines of meth on the counter telling each brother to take a line so they don't succumb to the depressant they took.

SCREENPLAY

EXT. CITY STREET - UNKNOWN TIME

The early morning or late night is ambiguous, the streets are nearly deserted. TOMMY and JACK stumble out of the brothel, their movements sluggish, their expressions hollow. The city around them feels both oppressively close and eerily distant as they meander without direction.

JACK
(squinting, confused)
What time is it even? Feels like the world stopped.

TOMMY
(grumbling)
Who cares? Time doesn’t do us any favors.

In the distance, a pharmacy sign flickers weakly. It’s an anchor in their aimless drift. A glimmer of hope, maybe a solution to their physical agony.

TOMMY (CONT'D)
Hey, maybe they’ve got something for this... this hell.

Their walk to the pharmacy is a battle against their own bodies. Each step is heavier, each breath a bit more desperate.

INT. PHARMACY - CONTINUOUS

The pharmacy is starkly bright, the lights harsh against their tired eyes. The PHARMACIST, a middle-aged woman with keen eyes, instantly reads their distress. Tommy collapses into a nearby chair, his body unable to carry the weight of his excesses.

PHARMACIST
(concerned, to Jack)
Your brother needs help. What did he take?

Jack’s face is a mixture of worry and defensiveness as he leans on the counter, his energy fading.

JACK
Just... something to calm down. Too much of everything, really.

Understanding the gravity of the situation, the pharmacist quickly retrieves a vial from behind the counter. She lays out two lines of meth on the counter with a practiced precision.

PHARMACIST
(firm, authoritative)
This isn’t a solution, but it’ll counteract the depressants. It’s dangerous, but it’s necessary right now.

Jack stares at the lines, his mind racing with the moral and medical implications. Tommy stirs, his eyes barely opening.

TOMMY
(hoarsely)
What’s... what’s that?

JACK
(torn)
It’s to keep us from crashing too hard. To keep you awake, keep you here.

Tension mounts as Jack contemplates their choices, the lines of meth a glaring challenge to their already battered morals.

PHARMACIST
(softer, but urgent)
I don’t usually do this, but I can see you two are in deep. Take it slow, and then we need to get him to a hospital.

Jack nods slowly, the weight of his brother’s life pressing down on him. He prepares to line up for his dose, a desperate measure in their continued spiral.

The scene closes with a focus on the brothers' faces, a mix of fear, resignation, and an unspoken plea for redemption, as they tread further down a path fraught with peril and uncertainty.
